## Core Checklist

This checklist contains properties that are relevant to any sequencing assay.


### Columns Explanation

* **Field Label**: A suggestion on the way to name this property in one's model.
* **Definition**: What does this property represent?
* **Is a Discovery property**: Whether the property is considered a desirable criterion to discover datasets in a given database. For instance, would this property be good to be supported in a GA4GH Beacon search?
* **Mandatory**: Is the property considered essential to properly understand the nature of the dataset? Should it be provided for every release dataset?
* **Type of data expected**: What kind of value is expected? Examples include an ontology CURIE, a string, or an URL.
* **How to fill details**: More detail than the previous "Type of data expected", including nuances. Also some tips on how to implement for brokers and repository owners etc..
* **Examples**: A few values that could be provided for that property. Those do not represent a exhaustive list.

Briefly, 1 µg of genomic DNA was fragmented to an average size of 350 bp using a Covaris S2 sonicator. The fragmented DNA was then end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated with Illumina adapters. The ligated products were purified using AMPure XP beads and quantified using a Qubit fluorometer. The final libraries were assessed for quality and quantity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and qPCR before sequencing. |

| `instrument`          | Technology platform used to perform nucleic acid sequencing, including name and/or number associated with a specific sequencing instrument model.
