International Human Epigenome Consortium(IHEC) already had a data model with metadata standards from EGA.

* The IHEC provided some input into the discussions of what is core metadata and what is specific to epigenomics.
* By [mapping](../mappings/IHEC.md) of the checklist with IHEC it allowed one to see the coverage of metadata fields.
* It also provided a way to be interoperable with any other application's data that is mapped to the experiment checklist
