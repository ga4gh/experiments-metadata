# Mappings
Projects making use of this checklist will map terms to their own data models to improve discoverability, rather than to enforce a fixed format. The checklist focuses on the meaning of each property, giving flexibility in how it's used, while providing clues as to better ways of using it (for example, by encouraging ontologies). Here we cover three projects/platforms (PCGL, ENA, and IHEC) to help others align. A schema for a more prescriptive approach is planned for future versions.

ENA and IHEC were strong contributors to the checklistâ€™s development, which explains their close mappings. PCGL adopted the checklist from the start and built its data model around it.
