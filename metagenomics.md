## Metagenomics

These are properties for Metagenomics that are non-core, and thus not found in all sequencing experiments. 

Some will be unique to this type of experiment and some common to several types.

Table of Metagenomics properties

| Field name | Specificity | Definition | Mandatory | Example | Type | Controlled Vocab Terms | Comment | MIxS | INSDC | IHEC (International Human<br>Epigenome Consortium) | Metagenomics publications |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target_loci | specific | Names the gene(s) or locus(loci) or other genomic feature(s) targeted by the sequence.[INSDC adapted] | FALSE |  | string |  | TBD: Need to generate the full list of genes and RNAs | target_gene | target_gene |  |  |
| target_subfragment | specific | TBD: | FALSE |  | string |  | To work out of this field is really needed | target_subfragment | target_subfragment |  |  |
| nucl_acid_ext_kit |  | The name of the extraction kit used to recover the nucleic acid fraction of an input material is performed | FALSE | QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit | string |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) | nucl_acid_ext_kit | nucleic acid extraction kit |  |  |
| nucl_acid_amp |  | A link to a literature reference, electronic resource or a standard operating procedure (SOP), that describes the enzymatic amplification (PCR, TMA, NASBA) of specific nucleic acids | FALSE |  |  |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) | nucl_acid_amp | nucleic acid amplification |  |  |
| pcr_primer_forward |  | Forward PCR primer (5' - 3') that were used to amplify the sequence of the targeted gene. The primer sequence should NOT contain MIDs and adapter sequences, and should be reported in uppercase letters. If multiple forward primers are present in a single PCR reaction, either report them separately in separate submissions (with separate OTU tables for each primer set), or list the primers here separated by pipe ( \| ) and provide one OTU table resulting from all the primers applied here. The latter is recommended only when the multiple primers target the same gene region and thus a single OTU table was generated from the multiplexed PCR. This term is required except for PCR free methods. | TRUE | GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC | string | IUPAC | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
| pcr_primer_reverse |  | Reverse PCR primer (5' - 3') that were used to amplify the sequence of the targeted gene. The primer sequence should NOT contain MIDs and adapter sequences, and should be reported in uppercase letters. If multiple reverse primers are present in a single PCR reaction, either report them separately in separate submissions (with separate OTU tables for each primer set), or list the primers here separated by pipe ( \| ) and provide one OTU table resulting from all the primers applied here. The latter is recommended only when the multiple primers target the same gene region and thus a single OTU table was generated from the multiplexed PCR. This term is required except for PCR free methods. | TRUE | GGRGGRTASACSGTTCASCCSGTSCC | string | IUPAC | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
| pcr_primer_name_forward |  | Name of the pcr_primer_forward. If multiple primers are listed in pcr_primer_forward, list the names respectively, separated by pipe ( \| ). | FALSE | mlCOIintF | string |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
| pcr_primer_name_reverse |  | Name of the pcr_primer_reverse. If multiple primers are listed in pcr_primer_reverse, list the names respectively, separated by pipe ( \| ). | FALSE | mlCOIintR | string |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
| pcr_primer_reference_forward |  | Reference (i.e. DOI) of the pcr_primer_forward. If multiple primers are listed in pcr_primer_forward, list the references respectively, separated by pipe ( \| ). | FALSE | https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-10-34 | string |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
| pcr_primer_reference_reverse |  | Reference (i.e. DOI) of the pcr_primer_reverse. If multiple primers are listed in pcr_primer_reverse, list the references respectively, separated by pipe ( \| ). | FALSE | https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-10-34 | string |  | (please hack, put in as an idea) |  |  |  |  |
