The European Nucleotide Archive(ENA) a representation member of the Internal Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration(INSDC). 
It was recognised within ENA and the wider INSDC that the sequence experiment metadata needed enhancing. There is also a push
to use public domain vocabularies especially ontologies were possible.

* The sequence experiment's metadata overall context can be seen in the [ENA Metadata model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html)
* The current field_names, definitions and controlled vocabularies are shared across INSDC 
* When sequence submitters submit sequences to ENA, they must provide values for all mandatory metadata field_names.

The ENA/INSDC field_names were used to provide a starting point for our discussions:
* Some of the improvements to nomenclature can already been seen in [mappings of the checklist to ENA's sequence experiment object](../mappings/INSDC_ENA.md)
* We were also about to gain consensus over what metadata is core and what is more specific to different assay types.
* The ENA/INSDC platform and instrument list, was similarly used as a basis to see identify some of what is missing from OBI and GenEpiO ontologies. With other project members provided further sequencing instruments.
* ENA now better knows what field_names to provide and vocabularies to use (or map to)
* This product is thus helping guide ENA/INSDC to more relevant to modern science using NGS, as well as being more interoperable.
